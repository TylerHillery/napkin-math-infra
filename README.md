# Overview
The purpose of this repository is to provide the infrastructure necessary to measure and benchmark common programming operations for the Napkin Math project. Napkin Math is a resource aimed at helping engineers estimate the performance of systems using first-principles reasoning. By leveraging this infrastructure, you can gather precise metrics on operations like memory reads, storage costs, and other fundamental computations.
